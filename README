This project requires a command-line media player to be installed.
This application is currently configured with omxplayer (apt-get install omxplayer) but others such as mpg321 can be used by editing the #define PLAYER_CMD on line 39
The GPIO pins used are hardcoded and can be updated by editing the #define HOOK_PIN, DIAL_PIN, and PULSE_PIN in RedPhone.cpp and recompiling.

There is nothing revolutionary about the source code. Feel free to modify it to your heart's content.

The bcm2835.cpp/h are not my creation, I take no credit for it. They are provided here for convenience. I may have added some type casts to silence warnings.

Compile with "g++ RedPhone.cpp bcm2835.cpp -o redphone -lc"

Create 10 subdirectories. 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
Populate those subdirectories with mp3 and wav files that you'd like to play when certain numbers are dialled on the phone.

The tool spawns a daemon when executed, so it will appear to immediately terminate. You will see it running by running "ps -A | grep redphone"

Enjoy
